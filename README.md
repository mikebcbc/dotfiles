# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files for everything in my dot configs.

## Included Configurations

- **Fish Shell**: My preferred shell configuration with custom functions, aliases, and keybindings.
- **Neovim**: i use neovim btw.
- **Zellij**: Terminal workspace manager configuration.
- **Wezterm**: My terminal emulator configuration.
- **borders, yabai, skhd**: All so I don't have to take my hands off the keyboard.

## Installation

If I were you, I wouldn't run this unless you're me. However, if you really want to, you can clone the repository and run the install script to symlink the files to their appropriate locations. Hereâ€™s how:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikebcbc/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This script will create symlinks for the various dotfiles to their expected locations.
